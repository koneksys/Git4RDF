	-help:
	Print the help menu with all commands

	-C [<path>]
	Set the directory of the workspace and initialize it. The current working directory is set as the default path, if no <path> is specified.
	If the directory already runs as a KLD workspace, the current state will be adopted.

	-config [user.name „authorname“] [rdfFormat „format“] [QVF „boolean“]:
	Set configurations for the program
	user.name: Set author ID for commit information
	rdfFormat: Set format for RDF data input and output
	QVF: quarter visualization format: Determine, wether both version model and application model should be shown
		concurrently or only one at a time

	-init [<path>]:
	Set the path for the local repository and initialize it. If no path argument is added, the current working directory
	will be set as the parent directory for the local repository.

	-load [<path>] [-local]:
		path: Load RDF dataset stored in the appropriate form (see config and log) in a text file into the working directory
		-local: Update your workspace with the current version of the local repository

	-clone:

	-dir <path>:
	Set the directory of the local repository. The given directory indicated by <path> has to be a previously initialized repository

	-pwd:
	Request current working directory

	-gui [-workspace] [-localrepo]:
	Display graphs in graphical visualization
	If argument workspace is appended and QVF = false, workspace models will be displayed
	If argument localrepo is appended and QVF = false, local repository models will be displayed

	-index:
	Display content of index layer

	-add [-a] [-#]:
	Add unstaged changes to index layer
		-a adds all unstaged changes
		-# adds the corresponding change identified by the given number

	-rm:
	Remove content from index layer
		-a removes everything
		-# removes the corresponding change identified by the given number

	-reset:
	
	-tag:
	Highlight particular commit with additional literal

	-branch:
	Print out the identifier of the last commit of every branch and identify the current branch

	-merge [-[#]]:
	Merge two commits from different branches in the local repository together by creating a union of the two RDF dataset
		-[#]: Merge branch indicated by ‚#‘ to current branch

	-push:

	-pull:

	-commit [-a]:
	Add all changes from the index layer to the local repository
		-a: Add all unstaged changes to the local repository irrespective of the state of the index layer
	 
	-checkout [-b] [-[#]]:
		-b: Create new branch and switch to it
		-[#]: Change current branch to branch indicated by number

	-fetch:

	-change [-script] [-select] [-tag]:
	Add changes to the dataset in the workspace
		-script: Enables modification via sparql scripts
		-select: Enables modification by selecting the type of modification and the respective triple
		-tag: Highlights a specific commit in the workspace history

	-show [-version] [-branch] [-merge] [-tag]:
	Enables overview of the workspace history
		-version: displays the state of the dataset at a certain point in time both via the GUI and via the console
		-branch: generates a new branch of commits in the workspace
		-merge: merges two commits by generating the union of the two datasets
		-tag: Highlights a specific commit in the workspace history

	-log:
	Prints out the configurations of the program:
	File format: format for dataset storage and retrieval,
	Author ID: name of the author
	Quarter Visualization: GUI output format (if true: four windows, if false, two windows)
	
	-status:
	List all unstaged changes (= differences between dataset in workspace and dataset in local repository)

	-exit:
	Exit the program and delete the workspace environment
